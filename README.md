# mindfulness-hub-react
a mindfulness hub created in React



### Task Log
- learn React Router


Problems
- My first big problem was that I couldn't figure out how exactly I wanted to handle multiple inputs. From what I learned and after watching tutorials, it seemed like creating a state for each separate input would be the answer, but this just seemed so long. Also, most of the answers weere in class-based components, so ....

Finally, I saw this article: https://dev.to/deboragaleano/how-to-handle-multiple-inputs-in-react-55el
This is exactly how I wanted to go about it! Starting with an empty form and then just adding into it by updating the state, without having 5 different states to update!
